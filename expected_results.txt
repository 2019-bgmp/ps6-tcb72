# total length of 182
# N50 is at 91st nucleotide
# 91st nucleotide is in the second sequence
# length of second sequence is 57
# therefore, N50 is 57.

#maximum contig length
#max of 70, 55, 57, so max is 70.

#mean contig length
#mean is (70+55+57) / 3, which is approximately 60.67

#total length
#total length is 70 + 55 + 57, which is 182.

#number of contigs
#number of contigs is 3

#mean depth of coverage
#coverage for single contig is Ck * L / (L - Lk + 1) where L is physical length
#first: L is 70, Ck is 19.4929384, Lk is 49. Plug that in, C = 62.02
#second: L is 55, Ck is 52.4303022, Lk is 49. Plug that in, C = 411.95
#third: L is 57, Ck is 43.1929483, Lk is 49. Plug that in, C = 273.55
#average: (62.02+411.95+273.55)/3 = 249.173
