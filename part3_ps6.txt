1. As kmer length increases:

-Number of contigs decreases
-Total length decreases
-Mean contig length increases
-Mean depth of coverage increases
-N50 increases

Increasing kmer length causes a much flatter distribution. This is because
the total amount of contigs decreases as kmer length increases.

2. As coverage cutoff goes up (auto was ~16x):
-Number of contigs decreases
-Total length decreases
-Mean contig length increases
-Mean depth of coverage increases
-N50 increases

With respect to the de Bruijin graph, it essentially cuts off any node in which the coverage for that
particular contig is less than the limit that we set.

Auto is calculated by taking the weighted median contig coverage depth, then dividing that by 2.
In our case, it was approximately 16.87x.

3. Increasing minimum contig length will create a much flatter distribution since you are
artificially cutting out more and more contigs. It will also increase N50, because
N50 is directly proportional to average contig length. By artificially selecting
higher and higher contig lengths, you are also artificially increasing N50.
